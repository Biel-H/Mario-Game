# Hello, Welcome to my attempt to create a simple game!

This project was created for a study purpose, so here i made a simple Mario Game using CSS, HTML and javaScript.
It's my first experience using JavaScript and my intention it's improve the game's functions over the time. I hope you enjoy!

## Some notes

In the lasted code improvements i added a restart button, and apply the logic directly in the html code with the "location.replace('')" method.

The other one was a "Game-over" image that appear when the mario caracter crashes the pipe.
